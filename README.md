Computation of regional development index using package `crodi` has two basic steps:

* Normalization of indicators using function `normalize()`.
* Computation of composite index using function `devindex()`.

[Package vignette](https://github.com/dataspekt/crodi/blob/master/inst/doc/crodi.html) illustrates two methods which were used for computation of Croatian regional development index in years 2017 and 2013, some other variants and convenience functions.
